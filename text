Rosa Parks was an African American woman who is remembered for her pivotal role in the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. Her refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955 sparked a wave of protests and boycotts that eventually led to the desegregation of public transportation in the city.

Parks was born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. She grew up in a family that valued education and activism, and she was exposed to racial discrimination from an early age. Despite facing many challenges, she excelled in school and went on to become a seamstress, a job she held for many years.

In 1943, Parks became involved with the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Montgomery. She served as the chapter's secretary and worked alongside other activists to fight against racial segregation and discrimination in the city.

On December 1, 1955, Parks boarded a bus in Montgomery to go home from work. She sat in the first row of seats designated for black passengers, but when the bus became crowded, the driver demanded that she give up her seat to a white passenger. Parks refused, saying that she was tired of being treated like a second-class citizen. The driver called the police, and Parks was arrested.

News of Parks' arrest spread quickly, and the Montgomery bus boycott was born. African American citizens refused to ride the buses in Montgomery, instead opting to walk or carpool to their destinations. The boycott lasted for over a year, and Parks became a symbol of resistance and courage in the face of discrimination.

Parks' actions were not without consequences, however. She and her husband lost their jobs, and they were subjected to threats and harassment. But Parks remained committed to the cause of racial justice, and she continued to work with the NAACP and other organizations to fight against segregation and discrimination.

In 1957, Parks and her husband moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she continued to work for civil rights. She became involved in a number of organizations, including the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the NAACP. She worked tirelessly to promote voter registration and education, and she spoke out against police brutality and other forms of racial injustice.

Throughout her life, Parks remained a symbol of courage and determination in the face of oppression. She received numerous awards and honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Spingarn Medal. Parks died on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92.

Today, Parks is remembered as a hero of the Civil Rights Movement. Her refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus sparked a wave of protests and boycotts that helped to bring an end to segregation in public transportation. Her legacy lives on, inspiring future generations to fight against injustice and inequality.
